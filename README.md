# Fitness-Tracker-App
A modular health and fitness app supporting exercise, diet, and progress tracking through a CLI. Applied OOP concepts like inheritance and polymorphism for extensibility and code reuse. Used structured file I/O and basic data structures to manage user data and tracking metrics.
